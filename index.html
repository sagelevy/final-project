            What is it like to be a UMD with a disability? Emily Yang, a senior psychology and criminology major with a minor in human development shares her thoughts in an interview.
         </p>
      </div>
      <div id="content" class="content-wrapper">
         <p>
            As someone who occasionally uses a prosthetic leg and other times a wheelchair or crutches to go about her day, Yang addresses some experiences where, according to her, UMD has not supported its students with physical disabilities.
         </p>
         <p>
            One aspect that has caused her challenge is the physical campus itself, which she says limits her mobility.
         </p>
         <div class="graphic">
            <iframe title="Long Distances and High Elevation Changes Make Mobility Difficult  " aria-label="Locator maps" id="datawrapper-chart-4hYBB" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/4hYBB/11/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="512"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script>
         </div>
         <p>
            Yang also mentioned that programs in place like the <span class="special"><a href="https://transportation.umd.edu/shuttle-um/paratransit"  target="_blank">paratransit</a></span> system are too ineffective and disorganized to actually improve the situation. She describes an experience trying to schedule her rides with paratransit, which she says became much more complicated than necessary and did not result in her getting any assistance.
         </p>
         <blockquote>
            She said, “I was so mentally exhausted just talking to paratransit that I just decided to ask my friends to help me around campus, because I was just so done with the process.”
         </blockquote>
         <p>
            Yang feels that because of situations like these which limit her mobility, her day to day and education are being imposed upon, taking away from just being a student. And based on the statistics, she is not alone. There is a large gap between people with and without disabilities’ education levels.
         </p>

         <div class="blockquote">
            <blockquote>
               “At every step I’m trying to be a good student and trying to participate, enjoying learning and enjoying the material in my class. It's so disheartening to see that I'm struggling just to get to class,” she said.
            </blockquote>
         </div>
         <p>
            However, despite the <span class="special"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2021/11/01/colleges-return-students-disabilities/" target="_blank">lack of institutional support</a></span>, Yang says her support system of friends is an essential piece of her ability to navigate UMD, although she also feels they shouldn’t need to step up in the first place.
         </p>
         <p>
            Yang said, “all these barriers are not only putting a lot on me, it's putting a lot on my friends as well, because I'm constantly asking them to help me with things that I should just be able to get easily.”
         </p>
         <p>
            She added, "as a student, it was so much for me to balance just trying to go about my life because these [accommodations] that were supposed to be in place for me were not there for me when I needed them, which was a big issue."
